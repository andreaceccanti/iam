## 0.3.0 (2016-07-12)

This is the first public release of the INDIGO Identity and Access Management
Service.

The IAM is an OpenID-connect identity provider which provides:

- OpenID-connect and OAuth client registration and management (leveraging and
  extending the [MitreID connect server][mitre] functionality
- [SCIM][scim] user and group provisioning and management
- A partial implementation of the [OAuth Token Exchange draft
  standard][token-exchange] for OAuth token delegation and impersonation

The IAM is currently released as a [Docker image][iam-image] hosted on
Dockerhub.

Documentation on how to build and run the service can be found in the [IAM
GitBook manual][gitbook-manual] or on [Github][github-doc].
